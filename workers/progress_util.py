"""
Progress payload enrichment — turns a plain stage-name string emitted by a
pipeline into the granular, Jenkins-style progress payload consumed by the UI.

Design constraints (see tests/test_progress_schema.py):
  - Pure and side-effect free — no Celery, no DB, no I/O. Easy to unit-test.
  - The pipeline callback contract stays ``progress(stage: str)`` (a string), so
    this enrichment happens DOWNSTREAM in the worker, never inside pipelines.
  - ``overall_percent`` is MONOTONIC: callers pass the previous value and it is
    clamped so the global bar never moves backwards, even for unknown/wrapper
    stages ("Executing pipeline...", "Saving results...").
  - Backward compatible: the returned dict always contains a ``"stage"`` key
    (the raw string) so older consumers keep working.

Progress is pure observation. It is emitted via the Celery task state (Redis),
never written to SQLite, so there is no DB-write amplification to throttle.
